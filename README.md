# To-do List App

I created this app to Learn how to use React Hooks with { useState }.

The main function of the app is to generate and display one or multiple tasks with two functions: 
* To check complete
* To delete

I plan to update the project with more functions in the future.

## What my code does.
1. The Form element allows the user to input a task that they need to complete.
2. The input is passed through a function that generates an li element that displays the current task.
3. The Current task can then be checked and completed.
4. When there are too many tasks or a task needs to be removed the user can click the delete button.
5. This action and the current task/s will be saved locally and will remain even when the page is refreshed.
